    of things, not excluding seaweed, seagull feathers, house detergents, and lamb mucus.
    Once he discovered the world of wizadry and attending Hogwarts, he quickly
    rose through the ranks to become Hufflepuff's head chef. 30 years later, Bertie
    is still using his creativenss and passion to run his own restaurant and candy shop,
