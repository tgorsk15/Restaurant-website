# Restaurant-website

This project encompasses the skills I used or learned to build a
standard website customers would interact with for a restaurant.
The project is structured on pulling in multiple JavaScript files
into one main.js file, thus increasing the organization of the program without sacrificing any efficiency in loadtime or computing power. Below are some of the main skills I developed

- learned to use webpack to bundle multiple files and produce a final bundle of the code

- Developed crucial skills of separating components of a program into multiple .js files to increase readability and organization

- learned the syntax for both imports and exports, getting practice with default exports/imports as well
